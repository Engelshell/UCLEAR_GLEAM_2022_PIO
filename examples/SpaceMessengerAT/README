In AT (Transparency mode) under 802.15.4 the Xbee's will communicate as if they are serial devices.
The underlying data sent to an Xbee over serial is converted into the 802.15.4 standard, which means
it acts similiar to TCP in that it uses ack's, guarantees packet order, and is a "transparent" stream
of data.

We use the COBS protocol with the PacketSerial library to turn the stream of data into defined "messages" 
that we construct.
